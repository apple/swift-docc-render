# DocC Render

@Metadata {
  @TechnologyRoot
}

A web renderer for DocC Archives produced by DocC.

## Overview

DocC Render allows you to display documentation produced by [DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/distributing-documentation-to-other-developers) and is included by default in DocC Archives.

### How It Works

DocC Render is a Single Page Application, powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). SPAs are web apps that are rendered entirely in the browser using JavaScript. Pages and content are generated dynamically at runtime, based on DocC generated render JSON data.
